Hey! I‚Äôm Krithika, an incoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the Johns Hopkins [Centre for Language and Speech Processing][https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/].

My research interests lie in studying the harms caused by language models, as well as the fairness, interpretability, privacy and efficiency aspects of these models. I'm largely motivated by issues regarding how the problems we face in NLP could amplify (and even introduce) societal concerns and unequal power dynamics.

I previously worked as a research intern at Microsoft Research India under the guidance of [Dr. Sunayana Sitaram](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/susitara/) where I worked primarily on fairness in language models. Prior to this, I interned at the Indian School of Business, where I was mentored by [Dr. Sumeet Kumar](http://sumeetkumar.in/) and [Dr. Ashique KhudaBukhsh](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~akhudabu/) and worked on problems related to the potential harm caused by AI systems and tools.

Some of my current research questions/topics revolve around:  
  * What sorts of biases exist in language models, and how do we study them from an intersectional view? How can we mitigate the disparate treatment we observe in models? 
  * Model interpretability and the risks of privacy in natural language processing 
  * How fair are compressed models?  

During my undergraduate degree, I co-founded the Research Society MIT, an organization dedicated to guiding undergraduate students from a multitude of different fields in research, to foster and make the research culture more habitable for students. We‚Äôre always looking for potential collaborations and would be grateful for external assistance, so if you would like to assist the organization in any way, you can reach out to them at their [e-mail](mailto:research.society.mit@gmail.com). A list of publications and projects underway is available at their website for your reference. 

If you're still reading this, you probably (maybe, hopefully) also want to know a little about me as a person. I run, I read (to some extent), I love video games (though I don't play them as much anymore), specifically RPGs like Divinity Original Sin: II, Mass Effect and Dragon Age. I've even actually recently begun to learn to play the keyboard so that I can play the music from these games! Some of the podcasts that I think are fantastic are [Unexplainable](https://www.vox.com/unexplainable) and [Flash Forward](https://www.flashforwardpod.com/) (does this page sound more like an advert at this point?).  

I‚Äôm always open to discussion, so if you have any queries related to anything, or if there‚Äôs any way I could help you, feel free to drop me a [mail](mailto:kramesh.tlw@gmail.com) or contact me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolenpyjak)!
