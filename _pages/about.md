Hey! I’m Krithika, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the Johns Hopkins [Centre for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) where I'm advised by [Dr. Anjalie Field](https://anjalief.github.io/). My research focuses on privacy and memorization in language models and my work has primarily been centered around elements that are essential for building trustworthy systems.

I have previously been a visiting student at IISc, where I worked with [Dr. Danish Pruthi](https://danishpruthi.com/). Prior to beginning my Ph.D., I worked as a research intern at Microsoft Research India with [Dr. Sunayana Sitaram](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/susitara/) and with the [EzPC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ezpc-easy-secure-multi-party-computation/) team. I have also been fortunate to have worked with and advised by [Dr. Sumeet Kumar](http://sumeetkumar.in/) and [Dr. Ashique KhudaBukhsh](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~akhudabu/).

I’m always open to discussion, so if you have any queries related to anything, or if there’s any way I could help you, feel free to drop me a [mail](mailto:kramesh.tlw@gmail.com) or contact me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolenpyjak)!
