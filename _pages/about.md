Hey! I‚Äôm Krithika, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the Johns Hopkins [Centre for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) where I'm advised by [Dr. Anjalie Field](https://anjalief.github.io/). My research centers primarily on privacy and memorization in NLP, and other areas that are essential for the development of trustworthy NLP systems, such as interpretability and fairness.

I've previously worked as a research intern at Microsoft Research India under the guidance of [Dr. Sunayana Sitaram](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/susitara/). Prior to this, I interned with the [EzPC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ezpc-easy-secure-multi-party-computation/) team at Microsoft Research India, and at the Indian School of Business, where I was mentored by [Dr. Sumeet Kumar](http://sumeetkumar.in/) and [Dr. Ashique KhudaBukhsh](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~akhudabu/).

If you're still reading this, you probably (maybe, hopefully) also want to know a little about me as a person. I run, I read (to some extent), I love video games (though I don't play them as much anymore), specifically RPGs like Divinity Original Sin: II, Mass Effect and Dragon Age. I've even actually recently begun to learn to play the keyboard so that I can play the music from these games! Some of the podcasts that I think are fantastic are [Unexplainable](https://www.vox.com/unexplainable) and [Flash Forward](https://www.flashforwardpod.com/) (does this page sound more like an advert at this point?).  

I‚Äôm always open to discussion, so if you have any queries related to anything, or if there‚Äôs any way I could help you, feel free to drop me a [mail](mailto:kramesh.tlw@gmail.com) or contact me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stolenpyjak)!
